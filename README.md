# 📂 Data Structures Lab Programs & Notes (MSc Software Technology)  

## 🚀 Welcome to the Data Structures Repository!  

This repository contains **Data Structures lab programs, notes, and reference materials** for students pursuing **MSc Software Technology**. The goal is to provide a **structured and comprehensive resource** for learning, implementing, and understanding **data structures**.  

## 📌 Important Guidelines  

- **Do not** simply copy or download the files without understanding the concepts.  
- **Learn Git & GitHub** – If you are new to version control, take some time to understand how GitHub works. It is an essential skill for every programmer.  
- **Follow a structured approach** – Go through the notes, understand the logic behind each program, and then implement the code yourself.  
- **If you find any issues or improvements**, feel free to contribute and raise a pull request.
